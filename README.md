A self hosted, hierarchal note taking web app

I really like taking notes with Nuclino, but would prefer to self host. After trying a variety of note taking, wiki and knowledge management apps, I didn't care for any of them - wikis are ugly and timing consuming to maintain, non-hierarchal note taking isn't for me an I'm a minimalist at heart. Give me a way to create and format notes, and organize them into a folder structure. That's all I want.

Muon will have:
- A WYSISWYG markdown editor
- A hierarchal menu structure
- Pages stored as .md files for portability, no database required
